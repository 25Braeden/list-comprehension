This is a simple list comprehension tool that I made for a school project. It generates a list of 10 random numbers and can then tell you the:
Shared numbers between lists
Even numbers in each list
Odd numbers in each list
Prime numbers in each list

It can also give two varying farewell statements dependent on how much of the program you used.
